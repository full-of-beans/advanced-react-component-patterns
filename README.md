## System Requirements

* [git][git] v2.14.1 or greater
* [NodeJS][node] v8.9.4 or greater
* [npm][npm] v5.6.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Installing the dependencies

To get the dependencies installed, run:

```shell
npm i
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://advanced-react-patterns.netlify.com/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest) in watch mode. Read the
output and play around with it.
